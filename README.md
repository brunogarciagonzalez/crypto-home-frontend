            This 1-week project is powered by Ruby on Rails (API) and vanilla JS. This was a partner-project with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerry-w-lee/">Jerry Lee</a> as we were learning JS fundamentals.

                A single-page application that utilizes the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/">CryptoCompare API</a> and PlotlyJS to showcase charted price histories of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. The CryptoCompare API is leveraged once more to show live trade prices for the three aforementioned crypto currencies, by employing SocketsIO. ActionCable (Web Sockets) are employed to allow for a real-time chat between users. A simple (non-secure) login system is employed to allow users to take part in the chat feature.
